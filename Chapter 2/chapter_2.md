## 2.1 Costs and Risks of Implementing a Test Automation Solution

### 2.1.1 Compare Alternative Technical Solutions with Regard to Cost of Ownership

When weighing cost of ownership, organizations can choose:

| Approach                     | Pros                                                                                   | Cons                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **In‑house custom solution** | Full control of design, data and governance; no vendor lock‑in                         | Requires skilled engineers, hardware, training; all costs borne internally           |
| **Vendor‑based solution**    | Faster adoption if tool already piloted; vendor support and expertise available        | Shared ownership; adding features or fixes depends on vendor timelines and contracts |
| **Outsourced solution**      | No need to hire/train TAEs or buy infrastructure; clear deliverables in contract       | Less internal control; contract must define metrics and SLAs                         |

Choose based on available skills, budget, timeline and long‑term maintenance capacity.

### 2.1.2 Explain Licensing Model Considerations for Test Automation Tools

Different licensing models has different impact on usability and cost factors e.g., costs of test execution, and difficulty to set up the development environment.

| License Type         | Description                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Open‑source**      | No license fees; community support; full code access for customization; may require internal expertise.       |
| **Per user / machine** | Predictable cost based on known number of testers or machines; volume discounts often available.              |
| **Floating**         | Shares licenses among concurrent users; lowers cost when testers work at different times                      |
| **Runtime (Cloud)**  | Pay‑per‑use for cloud‑hosted tools or device farms; scales with use but requires careful monitoring to avoid over‑run charges |

Consider execution volume, team size, maintenance and support requirements when selecting a model.

### 2.1.3 Provide Examples of Factors to Be Considered When Defining a Test Automation Strategy

A robust strategy balances technical, financial and organizational factors:

| Factor                         | Impact on Strategy                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time constraints**                   | Short deadlines favor small, focused pilots; longer projects allow broader automation coverage.       |
| **Expertise Level & Number of TAEs**       | Number and skill level of TAEs dictates complexity of framework and language choices.                |
| **Test hardware, Licenses**    | Budget for licenses, infrastructure, cloud resources, training.                                      |
| **Adaptability, Maintenance and Platform Support**           | Need for web, desktop, mobile, API or embedded testing.                                             |
| **CI/CD Support**          | Compatibility with existing pipelines and DevOps toolchain                                          |
| **Test management & reporting**| Ability to feed results into ALM/QMS and generate actionable dashboards                            |
| **Maintenance load**           | Frequency of SUT changes, test retirement process, ease of updating test scripts and libraries      |

The larger and more complex the SUT and release schedule is, the more resources the organization will require, which will increase the cost as well.

## 2.2 Roles and Responsibilities within Test Automation

### 2.2.1 Summarize the Roles and Skills Necessary for a Successful Test Automation Solution

Successful automation requires a blend of technical and domain expertise:

| Role                         | Key Skills & Responsibilities                                                                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Automation Engineer** | Programming, framework design, SUT architecture understanding, scripting, debugging, CI/CD integration |
| **Test Architect / Lead**    | Define strategy, select tools, design TAA/TAF, oversee pilot, ensure maintainability                  |
| **Subject Matter Expert**    | Provide business domain knowledge, help prioritize test scenarios, validate coverage                  |
| **Test Manager**             | Plan staffing and budgets, track progress, integrate automation into test plans and reporting          |
| **Developers / DevOps**      | Collaborate on testability features, support environment setup, integrate test suites into pipelines   |

Effective collaboration among these roles ensures the automation solution aligns with technical needs and business goals.

## Summary

- Ownership models (in‑house, vendor‑based, outsourced) carry different cost, control and risk profiles.
- License choice (open‑source, user‑based, floating, runtime) impacts both budget and flexibility.
- Strategy must account for timeline, expertise, cost, platform support, CI/CD integration and maintenance.
- Clear role definitions—from engineers to architects to SMEs—drive successful automation delivery.
