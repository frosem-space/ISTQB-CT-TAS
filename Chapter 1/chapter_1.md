## 1.1 Success Factors of a Test Automation Project

### 1.1.1 Explain the Objectives and Relevance of Test Automation

Before starting test automation, a strategy must be defined. This involves:

- Clarifying the purpose and test goals.
- Identifying project risks and stakeholder involvement.
- Defining the scope of automation and environments.
- Selecting tools and designing the test automation architecture (TAA).

#### Common test automation objectives:

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Improve test efficiency | Reduce effort and increase repeatability. |
| Increase test coverage | Automate broad and deep test conditions. |
| Improve SUT quality | Detect issues earlier and more often. |
| Reduce time and cost to market | Enable faster feedback and delivery. |
| Enable tests not possible manually | Cover technical and backend areas. |
| Increase test frequency | Support frequent execution and continuous testing. |

Modern development (e.g., Agile, cloud-based) demands faster cycles and earlier feedback, making automation more relevant for quality assurance.

### 1.1.2 Identify Technical Success Factors of a Test Automation Project

Technical success factors are those that ensure the test automation solution is useful, maintainable, and scalable over time.

The use of a **pilot project** helps determine the tools and viability of selected technologies.

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **SUT testability** | The SUT must expose interfaces needed for automation. |
| **Clear and applicable Test Automation Strategy** | Goals must be achievable within time, cost constraints, and kept updated. |
| **Test Automation Architecture (TAA)** | Clear structure and guidance for what and how to automate. |
| **Test Automation Framework (TAF)** | Easy to use, documented, maintainable, and supports a consistent automation approach. |
| **Test reporting** | Provides results in a way that supports analysis and follow-up. |
| **Troubleshooting** | Logs and reports must make it easy to identify failures. |
| **Test environments** | The TAS must support needed environments with configuration control. |
| **Automated test documentation** | Tests must be traceable and documented properly. |
| **Traceability** | Tests should link to requirements and manual test cases. |
| **Maintenance** | Automated tests must be easy to update when the SUT changes. |
| **Test retirement (up-to-date)** | Obsolete tests should be identified and removed or updated. |
| **Deployment plan** | There must be a process to roll out and update the TAS. |
| **Execution plan** | The automation should have a schedule and responsible roles. |
| **Exception handling** | The TAS must handle errors and recover reliably. |

A **pilot project** helps test tools and approaches before full implementation. Not all factors will be fully satisfied in every project, but understanding and evaluating them early increases chances of success.

### 1.1.3 Summarize Appropriate Investment Criteria in Selecting Candidate Projects for Test Automation

Test automation introduces cost and requires proper justification. Not every project is suitable for automation.

#### Investment considerations:

| Criteria | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Introduction cost** | May require hiring automation engineers, buying tools, training, or infrastructure. |
| **Project phase** | Early-stage in SDLC projects benefit more from automation than late ones. |
| **Planned project duration** | Short projects may not justify automation cost, as value won't be realized in time. |
| **Maintenance cost** | Setting up a TAS will take time along with the need to be maintained, especially if it starts from scratch. |

If the investment is justified, planning can start by selecting a proper test approach and tools. This responsibility typically lies with test architects or test managers who have experience in automation strategy.

## Summary

- Test automation needs a clear strategy that includes objectives, scope, risks, environments, tools, and stakeholders.
- Success depends on having testable systems, defined architecture and framework, clear reporting, easy troubleshooting, and maintainable tests.
- Before investing in automation, consider timing, project length, maintenance effort, and available resources.
- Strategic roles like test architects should guide the decision to proceed and the choice of tools and framework.
