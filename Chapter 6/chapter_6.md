## 6.1 Transitioning Activities from Manual Testing to Continuous Testing

### 6.1.1 Describe the Factors and Planning Activities in Transitioning from Manual Testing to Test Automation

Transitioning starts with automating regression tests, as they grow to become too many for a manual team to handle within project timelines.

| Considerations | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Increased transition cost** | Initial cost is higher because both manual and automated testing run in parallel. Once automation is stable, focus shifts to exploratory testing and new automation tasks. |
| **Functional overlap** | Avoid duplicating shared test steps like login across test cases. Use reusable components to reduce maintenance like a flow model pattern. |
| **Data sharing** | If tests access the same data, use a shared and centralized source to prevent duplication and errors. |
| **Test interdependency** | Tests may rely on outputs of previous ones (e.g., dynamically created IDs). TAS should be able to store and pass this data. |
| **Test execution preconditions** | Before scripting, identify everything a test needs to run reliably (user roles, database values, UI state). Automate the creation of preconditions where possible. |
| **Functional coverage** | Review gaps in automation coverage. Manual test cases are not always all that can or should be automated. Use freed-up time from automation to explore and increase coverage. |
| **Executable tests** | Only automate manual tests that are working correctly. Fix any issues with the manual version first to avoid automating broken tests. |

### 6.1.2 Describe the Factors and Planning Activities in Transitioning from Test Automation to Continuous Testing

Continuous testing means running tests automatically after every code change, giving faster feedback and reducing defect costs. This requires adapting the TAS, test suites, and infrastructure.

#### Required Actions:

- **Update test suites**: Modify test cases to run correctly in the new continuous testing setup.
- **Update interfaces and tools**: Adjust stubs, drivers, and test harnesses to match the updated TAS.
- **Check infrastructure**: Confirm infrastructure can support the TAS changes, including performance and connectivity.
- **Defect impact analysis**: Weigh risks of updating TAS against benefits. If defects are too serious, delay the rollout.
- **Defect tracking**: Communicate known issues through release notes and track fix timelines.
- **Integrate with pipelines**: The TAS must work within CI/CD pipelines, using orchestration tools to run tests post-deployment.

## 6.2 Test Automation Strategy Across the Organization

### 6.2.1 Conduct an Evaluation of the Test Automation Assets and Practices to Identify Improvement Areas

TAS must be continuously evaluated and improved to stay effective and efficient. This includes analysis during setup, ongoing use, and updates.

#### During Initial Deployment:

- **Code coverage analysis**: Use tools to measure how much code is covered by automated tests.
- **Requirements traceability**: Use matrices to show which SUT features are not yet tested.
- **Infrastructure standardization**: Ensure consistent use of TAS infrastructure across teams or projects.
- **Configuration management**: Implement versioning and control for all test suites.
- **Guidelines and best practices**: Follow structured TAS development practices (see CTAL-TAE).
- **Precondition automation**: Define and automate data setup or environment configuration needed before running tests.

#### During Updates and Maintenance:

- **Tool assessment**: Review if new tools or updated versions can improve TAS capabilities.
- **Optimization opportunities**: Continuously look for better performance or reduced execution time.
- **Script modularization**: Break scripts into reusable components for easier maintenance.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Make reusable components known and accessible across teams.
- **Functional overlap checks**: Reuse existing components when overlapping functionality is found.
- **Manual-to-automated backlog**: Identify more manual tests that can be automated in future iterations.
- **Test design and data improvements**: Enhance how test data is created, managed, and maintained.
- **Test suite synchronization**: Ensure test suites are updated to the latest TAS version.
- **Pipeline integration impact**: If automation slows down pipelines, create a lightweight smoke test suite for quick validation and run full regression suites separately.

---

## Summary

- Transitioning to automation begins with regression and must manage costs, data handling, test dependencies, and reusable design.
- Moving toward continuous testing requires infrastructure, tool, and test suite readiness, with a clear strategy for handling defects and updates.
- Organizational improvement relies on evaluating test coverage, tool usage, script quality, modularization, and TAS efficiency.
- Proper planning and regular reviews ensure the TAS evolves, stays maintainable, and continues to provide value.

> ✅ **Plan and monitor automation transitions carefully, and continually improve the TAS through evaluation and modular design.**

> ⚠️ **Neglecting preconditions, functional overlap, or poor test design can lead to wasteful and unstable test automation.**
